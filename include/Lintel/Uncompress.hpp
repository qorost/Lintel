    \brief utility I/O - file decompression
*/


/*
 * generic replacements for open()/close() when all you want to do is
 * read a (possibly compressed) file.
 * 
 * int openCompressed(const char *pathname)
 *	use like open(pathname, O_RDONLY), but will automagically decompress
 *	file as it's being read. return value is descriptor, all error checking
 *	(file exists etc) is done internally.
 * ssize_t readCompressed(int fd, void *buf, size_t nbytes)
 *	use like read(), read data from file opened by openCompressed
 * void closeCompressed(int fd)
 *	use like close(fd), closes file opened by openCompressed()
